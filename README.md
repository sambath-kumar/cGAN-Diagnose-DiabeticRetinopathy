# Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (C-GAN) for Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) diagnosis

The Dataset is available in [1] and a similar research work to generate synthetic OCTA images using dataset [1] is available in [2].

Proposed Methodology:
The fundus imaging has no depth information of retinal vasculature and OCTA has no direct visualization of the Optic Disc, macula. Both the modalities hold complementary feature maps with respect to DR diagnosis. We propose a first of the kind model, combining the two modalities i. (original) fundus images ii. (GAN synthesized) OCT-A images to diagnose DR. We feed the fundus images and BVAC synthesized OCT-A images to 2 ResNet 50 CNNs with a merged Fully Connected layer for DR diagnosis.

The following steps are executed to generate synthetic OCT-A image pair from Fundus image and diagnose DR.
1. Pre-processing steps
2. Pipeline to create dataset for train, test of Fundus and OCT-A images
3. Generator: Improved U-Net with Squeeze & Excitation (Entropy based) block
Encoder stage of U-Net: customized threshold-based Squeeze and excitaion (SE) block 
4. Loss: Generator loss, discriminator loss
5. Training the model
7. Develop a Web based application (APP) to predict OCT-A pair from Fundus image
